we will observe, when connecting to URL via web browser: 
http://52.150.19.84/

output is =>  appid: 3333 home page: says hello! 

output is not changing for sometime.

This is because default mode of haproxy is tcp which is layer4 haproxy. That means the moment browser connects to 
haproxy then it forwards me to one of backend and it creates a stateful TCP connection.

Browser is creating TCP  becuase asssuming HTTP use TCP the underlying TCP is now connected and is alive because brwoser wants to keep connections as alive as possible.
So on next request its not going to create a new connnection but uses the same connection which is already established to same backend server.

it will be more clear with telnet:

This time its doing roud robin because every telnet is new TCP socket created


Now its doing round robin:
azureuser@RGUbuntu:~$ curl http://52.150.19.84/
appid: 2222 home page: says hello!azureuser@RGUbuntu:~$
azureuser@RGUbuntu:~$ curl http://52.150.19.84/
appid: 3333 home page: says hello!azureuser@RGUbuntu:~$
azureuser@RGUbuntu:~$ curl http://52.150.19.84/
appid: 2222 home page: says hello!azureuser@RGUbuntu:~$
azureuser@RGUbuntu:~$ curl http://52.150.19.84/
appid: 4444 home page: says hello!azureuser@RGUbuntu:~$
