Objective: 
http://52.150.19.84/app1  to 2 backend servers => 2222 and 3333
http://52.150.19.84/app2  to other backend servers ==> 4444 and 5555


Added required configuration for 2 backends in app.cfg and also added acl rules to distinguish between them.

**Now:** 
sudo haproxy -f app.cfg

http://52.150.19.84/app2   =>  pointing to 4444 and 5555

http://52.150.19.84/app1   =>  pointing to 2222 and 3333

http://52.150.19.84/  => round robin to all 4 servers

Also we can add following for app1

   balance source
   
This would mean, until client ipaddress is not changing, it will connect to same host.
