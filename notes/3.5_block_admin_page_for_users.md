we want this page http://52.150.19.84/admin to be blocked

**current output:** appid: 2222 ADMIN page: very few people should see this

**Following will still work:** http://52.150.19.84:2222/admin


Added following acl for blocking  admin:

    acl admin path_end -i /admin
    http-request deny if admin


**Testing:**

http://52.150.19.84/admin

output:

403 Forbidden
Request forbidden by administrative rules.


http://52.150.19.84:2222/admin ==> still works
